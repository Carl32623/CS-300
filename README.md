Data Structures and Algorithms
Carl LaLonde

This work helped me to understand how different data structures can impact the performance and memory usage of a program.  I was able to write code that is functional, readable, adaptable and maintainable.  I was able to create a program that would read course data from a csv file and store this data in a Binary Search Tree.  The program also allowed users to search and display course information in alphanumeric order.  

I first implemented a Binary Search Tree to store courses, adding functions to load courses from the csv file, traverse the BST, and search for specific courses.  The program includes methods for inserting courses into the BST, printing the courses in alphanumeric order, and searching for a course, by course number.  Recursive functions such as insertion and traversing the tree helped in maintaining tree balance.  Implementing a BST helped me to understand the importance of organizing and commenting on my code.
